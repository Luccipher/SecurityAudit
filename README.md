FROM: ChatGPT
DATE: June 6, 2023
SUBJECT: Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations

Dear Colleagues,

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit findings and recommendations.

Scope:
The internal audit covered Botium Toys' assets, controls, and compliance with regulations and standards. It focused on on-premises equipment, employee equipment, system and software management, internet access, internal network, vendor access management, data center hosting services, data retention and storage, badge readers, and legacy system maintenance.

Goals:
The goals of the internal audit were to assess the company's security posture, identify areas of improvement, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

Critical Findings (must be addressed immediately):

Least Privilege Control: The implementation of the "Least Privilege" control is essential. This control ensures that vendors and non-authorized staff have access only to the assets and data necessary for their job responsibilities. Immediate implementation is required to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

Disaster Recovery Plans: It is crucial to establish comprehensive disaster recovery plans. These plans should address business continuity and minimize productivity downtime and system component impacts in the event of an incident. This includes considerations for the computer room environment, hardware, connectivity, applications, data, and restoration. Immediate attention is necessary to ensure business continuity and minimize potential losses.

Password Policies: Implementing robust password policies is necessary to enhance security and reduce the likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attack techniques. Immediate action should be taken to establish password strength rules and enforce their adherence.

Access Control Policies: Strengthening access control policies will increase the confidentiality and integrity of data within the organization. It is essential to implement measures that limit unauthorized access and ensure proper authentication and authorization protocols.

Account Management Policies: To reduce the attack surface and limit the overall impact of disgruntled or former employees, it is crucial to implement comprehensive account management policies. Immediate attention should be given to establish protocols for account creation, modification, and termination.

Separation of Duties: Implementing the principle of separation of duties is essential to prevent individuals from having excessive access privileges that could be abused for personal gain. Immediate action is required to ensure proper segregation of duties within the organization.

Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need):

Firewall: Firewalls are already in place to filter unwanted and malicious traffic from entering the internal network. No immediate action is required, but periodic review and updates are recommended to maintain effectiveness.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Implementing an Intrusion Detection System will allow the IT team to quickly identify possible intrusions, such as anomalous network traffic. While this control is not of immediate priority, it is strongly recommended for enhanced security.

Encryption: Implementing encryption measures for confidential information and data, especially for website payment transactions, is recommended. This control can be implemented on a medium to high priority basis to strengthen data security.

Backups: The establishment of regular data backups aligns with the disaster recovery plan and supports ongoing productivity in case of an event. Although this control is not of immediate concern, it should be addressed in a timely manner.

Password Management System: The implementation of a password management system that supports password recovery, reset, and lockout notifications is recommended. This control can be implemented on a high to medium priority basis to improve password management efficiency.

Antivirus (AV) Software: Implementing antivirus software is necessary to detect and quarantine known threats. While this control is not an immediate concern, it should be addressed to enhance overall system security.

Please take these findings and recommendations into consideration when creating appropriate documentation, processes
